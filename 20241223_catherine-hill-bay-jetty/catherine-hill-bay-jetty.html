					<p>In 1865, merchants Jacob Levi Montefiore and Thomas Hale headed north from Sydney in search of land for mining. Their journey led them to the Wallarah Peninsula—approximately 100 kilometers from Sydney—where they discovered rich coal deposits. By 1873, their mine had grown into a small mining town, complete with a manager’s residence, weatherboard cottages, and a simple wooden pier—the first predecessor to the now rusting steel pier.</p>  
					<p>The pier was key to the location's initial success, providing direct access to export coal by ship, both along Australia’s east coast and internationally. Unfortunatly, after a few short years, Montefiore and Hale went bankrupt, leaving their mining town, Cowper Township, abandoned. The small, poorly built wooden pier sat unattended and was slowly destroyed by the elements.</p>  
					<p>It wasn't long before a new company with English colonial connections established the Wallarah Coal Company and rebuilt the mining town and wooden pier—the second predecessor to the now rusting steel pier. With the second pier came a new identity for Cowper Township: it was renamed Catherine Hill Bay after the Catherine Hill schooner, which beached itself on Bird Island Point in 1867. This second pier lasted for nearly 100 years until it was partially destroyed in 1974 by a storm.</p>  
					<p>A third, more durable steel pier was eventually constructed and remained in use by the coal mine until 2002, when mining operations on the Wallarah Peninsula came to an end. While the Catherine Hill coal mine has since closed, coal-based energy generation still accounts for approximately <a class="link" href="https://www.energy.gov.au/energy-data/australian-energy-statistics/energy-consumption" target="_blank">26% of Australia's total energy production</a>. Although this figure has declined since its peak in 2008, Australia remains an outlier among developed nations due to the continued <a class="link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/24/tanya-plibersek-approves-three-coal-mine-expansions-in-move-criticised-as-the-opposite-of-climate-action" target="_blank">expansion of coal projects</a>.</p>
					<p>The third pier is officially closed to the public, but still accessible by a poorly secured ladder. The steel and concrete structure remains a landmark of the bay and popular spot for adventurous local teenagers to jump into the water below.</p>
