					<p>This memorial, to the many notable figures in the history of Bulgaria, is said to be the heaviest communist monument on Earth. It might also depict the most history of any communist monument, as it was built in 1981 to commemorate the 1,300th anniversary of the First Bulgarian state.</p>
					<p>Designed by Krum Damyanov and Ivan Slavov, and sitting atop the Ilchov Bair hill above Shumen, it can be seen from over 30 kilometers away. However, its towering exterior hides the complex's most interesting features: historical figures from Bulgaria's history depicted in abstract exposed concrete.</p>
