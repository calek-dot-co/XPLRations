					<p>"... the hundreds of corpses found every day along the exile road... the children torn away from their families ... placed by hundreds on board ship in nothing but their shirts, and then capsized and drowned in the Black Sea and the River Deyirmen Dere - these are my last ineffaceable memories of Trapezund, memories which still, at a month's distance, torment my soul and almost drive me frantic...</p>
					<p>... If they knew all the things that I know, all that I have had to see with my eyes and hear with my ears, all Christian powers that are still neutral would be impelled to rise up against Turkey and cry anathema against her inhuman Goverment and her ferocious 'Committee of Union and Progress', and they would extend the responsibility to Turkey's Allies, who tolerate or even shield with their strong arm these execrable crimes, which have not their equal in history, either mother or ancient. Shame, horror and disgrace!"</p>
					<p>– Giacomo gorrini, Italian diplomat</p>

					<p>The above quote, one I read at the museum at the Armenian Genocide Memorial, was one that stood out to me the most as providing a glimpse, however small, into the horrors of genocide.</p>

					<p>By the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was weakening and often described as "The Sick Man of Europe." Amidst this decline, a nationalist movement known as the Young Turks came to power. When World War I erupted in 1914, the Ottoman Empire aligned itself with Germany and Austria-Hungary, seeking to preserve its territorial integrity and gain protection from Britain and Russia.</p>
					<p>During this period, the Young Turks grew increasingly distrustful of ethnic minorities, particularly Christian Armenians, fearing they might support enemy powers like Russia. This paranoia soon escalated into state-sponsored persecution. Armenians were stripped of their civil rights, accused of treason, and labelled threats to national security. On April 24, 1915 the government arrested hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders.</p>
					<p>In the aftermath, Armenian men were either conscripted into forced labour battalions or executed. Women, children, and the elderly were subjected to brutal death marches through deserts. Entire villages were razed; families separated, abused, and slaughtered. Some were drowned in rivers, others burned alive, and many more perished from starvation, disease, or sheer exhaustion.</p>

					<p>The term "genocide", coined by Raphael Lemkin, finds its origin in this tragedy. By 1915, approximately two million Armenians lived within the Ottoman Empire. By 1918, one million had been systematically murdered. By 1923, virtually the entire Armenian population of Anatolian Turkey had vanished — victims of genocide or forced into exile.</p>
					<p><p>This memorial, and the accompanying museum just outside the centre of Yerevan, are dedicated to the lives lost in the first genocide of the 1900s. My visit coincided with the 110th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. While people are typically absent from my photographs, it was actually quite busy at the memorial, as thousands of Armenians brought flowers to lay around the eternal flame.</p></p>
