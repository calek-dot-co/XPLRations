					<p>At the end of a winding mountain road, high above the clouds on a supposedly enchanted mountain, is a former broadcasting tower for television and radio signals. Built at the end of the 60s, or maybe the beginning of the 70s, it was once part of a network of high-powered regional mountain relays that connected all the corners of Greece.</p>

					<p>At the base of the tower lies a scattering of a decaying facilities—dormitories, storage warehouses, generator buildings, rusting equipment, and several smaller broadcast towers that looked barely in use.</p>
					<p>The occasional colourful piece of graffiti breaks up the grey concrete structure, while decaying piles of rubbish poke out from the brambles. The unwelcoming landscape seemed frozen in time, dead still, waiting for something.</p>

					<p>Information about this tower was surprisingly scarce online. However, through my research, I discovered two sibling towers with similar designs elsewhere in Greece.</p>
					<p>Both, in contrast, appear to still be operational. One stands on Mount Parnitha near Athens; the other, smaller but more widely visited, is located in Thessaloniki. The latter has been fully embraced as a tourist attraction, complete with a rotating restaurant as one of its highlights.</p>

					<p>At the far side of the tower, I unexpectedly found the basement door wide open. I had visited purely from seeing this tower in the distance, not knowing if it would be open or not. A faint electrical hum could be heard beneath the soft rustling of wind and distant bird calls. It was like it was calling me inside.</p>

					<p>After passing fuel silos, generators, and power control systems, I found my way to the tower's central column, which contained a fourteen-floor elevator and a spiral staircase.</p>
					<p>At the foot of the stairs, the hum of electricity above was unmistakable. Something was definitely still alive in this tower.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
        		<div class="image-landscape"><img class="" src="17.jpg"></div>

				<div class="spacer"></div>
				<div class="text-content">	
					<p>I cautiously started to climb the stairs, pausing one floor at a time to listen for any clues about what was next, and to look out for cameras. As I climbed, I passed floors containing kitchens, living areas, and sleeping quarters. Half-empty bottles of alcohol, old calendars, and administrative notes from 1997 littered the rooms.</p>

        		<div class="spacer"></div>
				<div class="text-content">	
					<p>On the occasional floor, I found unlocked windows, offering access to the outer rings of the structure. Scattered unevenly across the concrete walls and floors were abandoned rigging, mounting brackets, and weather-worn poles.</p>
					<p>Pausing for a second to catch my breath from the stairs, I took in the amazing view down the mountainside and out over a sea of clouds.</p>

					<p>As I continued to climb, I arrived at the telecom relay floors, full of half-empty racks of aged equipment. A mixture of half-decommissioned analogue and early digital technology that once carried Greece’s communications. Strangely, the occasional status light still flickered, or a display showed meaningless numbers.</p>

				<div class="text-content">	
					<p>Even higher still, I found locked doors. The electrical humming was very loud now, escaping from the gaps at the bottom of the doors and out into the tower. New-looking, high-security locks secured whatever was still running in this tower.</p>
					<p>Was it heating equipment? Redundant military comms from the nearby bases? Or a pirate radio station? Unable to find the answers I wanted, I continued higher.</p>

				<div class="text-content">	
					<p>Finally, I reached the UFO dish of the tower on the tenth floor. With a footprint much larger than any other floor, this was likely the unrealised plan for a restaurant and scenic lookout, thwarted by its rural location.</p>
					<p>View-enjoyers who were here before me had obviously had a good time, based on the arrangement of old TVs and empty beer bottles.</p>

					<p>As if transported to another world, the three hundred and sixty-degree windows painted a surreal picture of the world below. Clouds and distant mountain peaks dominated the alien-looking horizon.</p>
					<p>As I stood enjoying the view, I could hear the occasional groan from the masts and antennas high above me, a strange proof of life from the abandoned tower.</p>
