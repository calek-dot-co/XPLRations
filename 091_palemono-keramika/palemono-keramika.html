					<p>Standing eye-level with this towering metal sign was the highlight of this exploration. 'Palemono Keramika'—visible from kilometers away atop an eight-story building—offered stunning views of the industrial outskirts of Kaunas when seen up close.</p>
					<p>I was keeping a low profile because it had been about half an hour since I accidentally wandered into the view of a security camera and heard announcements in Lithuanian from the half-abandoned, half-active brickworks site's PA system. While laying on the roof, I still managed to enjoyed the peaceful lake views framed by the browning autumn trees.</p>

					<p>As the sun started to dip towards the horizon, it was time to go.</p>
					<p>Down the convoluted maze of staircases that connected floors and buildings, through a hole in the wall, and over the fence that previously kept dogs in and humans out.</p>

					<p>Back on the ground I saw two teenagers who were also exploring the location. At first, they ran, mistaking me for security. They soon returned, and with the limited English one of them spoke, we shared stories of our adventures.</p>
					<p>As I headed out, they headed up, and before long I could see them taking selfies and recording TikToks on the roof next to the sign. So much for a low profile. I made my last rounds to check off having seen everything at this site, including material mixing pipes large enough to stand upright inside of.</p>

					<p>With the site fully explored, I exited via a railway siding and emerged from the bushes near my rental car. However, I wasn't alone. Six police cars were parked in the same lot, blocking the exit and the main road out of the business park.</p>
					<p>Were they here for me? Would they notice my dust-covered clothing, a telltale sign of my explorations? Or were they after the teenagers someone had likely spotted on the roof?</p>

					<p>With daylight fading, I made a choice. I would calmly drive past, feigning indifference. Pretending to be unaware of the forgotten brickworks buildings, and the spectacular views they offered, seemed like my best option.</p>
					<p>A quick wave to get out of the parking lot and I was off, not looking back.</p>
