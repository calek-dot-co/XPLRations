					<p>Architecture in the Soviet Union often reflecting the political and ideological values of its time, while simultaneously serving as a projection of state power. Many Soviet buildings can be characterized by their imposing, brutalist style and towering heights, but there are exceptions. One such example is the V. I. Lenin Palace of Culture and Sport—later renamed Linnahall—in Tallinn, Estonia.</p>
					<p>What Linnahall lacks in height, it makes up for in length, stretching nearly half a kilometer long. Its low profile was reportedly a deliberate choice by its architects, designed to link the city with the sea without obstructing views or disrupting the city’s silhouette. However, unfounded rumors also suggest that the building’s design could also have served a strategic purpose, allowing it to function as an artillery platform in the event of an invasion from the West.</p>
					<p>Constructed for the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics, Linnahall served as a satellite venue for sailing events in the then Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. After the Olympics, it continued to host cultural and sporting events, with its ice-skating rink and concert hall. Unfortunately, both facilities closed in 2009 and 2010, respectively.</p>
					<p>Despite various attempts to restore the crumbling structure, none have succeeded to date. Today, Linnahall stands disused, with its only activity being occasional guided tours that explore its Soviet-era history.</p>
