					<p>As I approached the top of the hill, the silhouettes of the facility began to emerge. Nothing special at first sight, a multi-storey structure surrounded by man-made earthen mounds. But I knew what lay inside would be anything but ordinary, if I could make it in there.</p>
					<p>After weaving through a dense patch of trees, I came upon a Soviet-era concrete fence. Up and over and into the grounds, quickly crossing the open space to the shelter of the trees on top of the man-made hill.</p>
					<p>Access to inside was somewhere, the area was scattered with hatches and ventilation shafts to check. After nearly thirty minutes of searching in the dark, I finally found the right one concealed beneath a tree.</p>

					<p>I opened it and slipped inside, entering a narrow cable tunnel, around thirty metres long, just wide enough to crawl on all fours. The tunnel sloped gently downwards toward an access shaft. At the end, I climbed out, balanced over a narrow wooden plank, and then descended a ladder. From there, I entered a vent that led to the crawlspace beneath raised flooring panels.</p>
					<p>Emerging through a missing floor panel, I found myself inside the facility—a decommissioned control centre once used for rapid-response fighter jets. It wasn’t large, but it served its purpose in decades past: a radar-equipped control room, a vehicle bay, and a command space detailing intercept protocols.</p>

					<p>But my reading was cut short, as an alarm suddenly went off—triggered perhaps by motion sensors, thermal detection, or both.</p>
					<p>I rushed to snap one final photo before scrambling back to the opening in the floor. Moving as fast as I could, I retraced my path—through the vent, up the ladder, across the board, through the tunnel, and out through the hatch.</p>

					<p>As I made my way back toward the fence, I spotted a car speeding up the service road toward the facility. I wasted no time—over the fence and back into the cover of the dark forest.</p>
					<p>As I descended the hill, I glanced back to see a flashlight sweeping the trees and facility—searching for something, or someone, that was already gone.</p>
