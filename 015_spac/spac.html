					<p>Spaç Prison is remote. Located up a winding dirt road in the sparsely populated district of Mirdita in northern Albania. From the day it was built, it served mining in the valley. Today, looming over the abandoned prison buildings is a huge industrial mine, quarrying the same land prisoners worked over 50 years ago. Instead of the iron fist of communism running the mine, this valley runs on the iron will of capitalism.</p>
					<p>The Spaç buildings are shells of their former selves, stripped of anything of value—steel, copper wire, tiles. Time has also taken much of the main building's structural integrity, in it's place are hundreds of red support columns keeping roofs and balconies standing.</p>
					<p>Build to house 53 prison miners alongside administrators, guards, and free workers, the 9 buildings witnessed one of the first democratic revolts in Albania's history. For 3 consecutive days, the prisoner's rebellion was successful and anti-communist slogans and dreams of joining the EU were voiced from the building. Special military troops then flooded over the weak, starved, and sleepless prisoners showing no mercy.</p>
					<p>With the main building's facade shaded by the angle of the winter sun and the fact that most of the buildings were built facing away from each other, it is easy to project human-like feelings of shame that this location must feel about it's, and the regime's, role in allowing this notorious labour camp to once exist.</p>

					<p>Translation: Memorial. Young people in the Diocese of Sapes commemorate the suffering of the thousands of Shoiptar victims of the dictatorship. These mountains serve as fresh evidence of the ongoing torture inflicted on innocent individuals. The pilgrimage to Spaç (Mirdite) prison is a fond memory for those who have considered freedom as the greatest right. March 31, 2007.</p>

					<p>Translation: Commemoration. Here in Spaç, the communist dictatorship built a prison-camp for political opponents. In this country, the regime used all methods of disfigurement on them through hard labor, violence and torture... these convicts, in May 1973, decided to rebel against this inhumane treatment, and organized a revolt under the call: here is death, here is freedom. For a few hours the revolt triumphed, the prisoners managed to take control of the camp, chasing away the police, and instead of the communist flag they raised the national flag, without the red star. The regime sent the army and the special police: it drowned the unarmed revolt in blood; shot 4 prisoners; added 25 years of imprisonment to dozens of people, and continued to intensify the barbaric violence against others...</p>
